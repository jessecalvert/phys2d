TODO

- debug
	- do less recursion, then remember to reduce the stack size.

- physics
	- one-shot manifolds
	- joints
		- add and remove joints (via ui)
		- uncollidable objects
	- decouple physics and render framerates

- editor
	- place objects/joints
	- build static geometry
	- save/load scenes

MISC:

- multithread and simd
- hotload opengl and platform layer
- looped live code editing
- better way to specify what should be drawn on top of what
- should we fix drawing text with a camera that has a non-1 aspect ratio?
- new matrix format
	- make simd-izable
	- most matrices are mostly zeros, mults and inverses could be easier if
		we could inspect this first.
